Minitanks-Client
================

This is my AI for the minitanks game at: https://github.com/penguinmenac3/minitanks-server

It currently includes two target acquirization methods:
--* Nearest target
--* Target with highest score

There is an optional basic (broken) dodge algorithm that checks for missile intersection within a "safe radius", in which case the tank decelerates.
